# NGO-Project
Surplus2Serve is a web-based platform designed to connect surplus food sources (restaurants, events, individuals) with NGOs and volunteers to redistribute food in real time, reducing food waste and supporting communities in need. The system enables donors, and NGOs/volunteers can claim and coordinate distribution efficiently.
